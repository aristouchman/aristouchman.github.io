    <h1>How Relationship Strengthens Control and Credit Efficiency in Banking</h1>
    <p><em>Published: April 28, 2025</em></p>

    <p>In the dynamic and highly regulated world of commercial banking, the success of any control, audit, or credit strategy often hinges not just on policies or systems, but on the strength of human relationships. Having spent over six years managing portfolios and navigating compliance challenges in Nigerian banks, I have come to appreciate how the <strong>depth of relationship between banker and client</strong> can influence risk outcomes, documentation accuracy, and credit performance.</p>

    <p>One experience in 2023 shaped my perspective permanently. I was the relationship manager of a high-net-worth corporate client whose operations spanned importation, construction, and general supply. The client had a procurement officer who occasionally brought in fund transfer instructions, sometimes on short notice. This was part of their normal internal delegation process — or so we thought.</p>

    <p>One afternoon, the procurement officer arrived with a ₦9.5 million transfer instruction. It was urgent and neatly signed. But something wasn’t right — the beneficiary was a personal account outside their known vendors, and the narration was unusually vague. I decided to hold back and call the account owner directly.</p>

    <p>“Good move,” he said when I asked if he authorized the transaction. “I didn’t instruct any transfer today.” We immediately halted the process. An internal investigation revealed that the officer had forged internal documents to initiate the fund transfer for selfish reasons — a serious breach of trust. If we had gone ahead, the funds would have been lost.</p>

    <p>That single call, based on a well-nurtured relationship, saved the client from fraud and the bank from reputational damage. It reinforced to me that relationship is more than sales — it's a control mechanism.</p>

    <p>In many cases, compliance issues stem from weak relationship management. When bankers treat clients like numbers rather than people, there’s less room for trust, open communication, and early detection of red flags. But when you invest time in understanding a client’s business, behaviour patterns, and transaction rhythm, you become more than a banker — you become a risk partner.</p>

    <p>In credit, strong relationships often mean early alerts when businesses are facing downturns. A client who trusts you will disclose financial challenges sooner, allowing for proactive restructuring instead of reactive recovery. This doesn’t just protect the client; it helps the bank avoid non-performing assets (NPAs) and improves overall portfolio health.</p>

    <p>Similarly, in internal control and audit, clients who maintain a healthy relationship with their RMs (Relationship Managers) are more likely to comply with documentation, KYC updates, and exception handling. They respond quicker, act transparently, and sometimes even offer suggestions that improve service design.</p>

    <p>Technology is great. Artificial intelligence is powerful. But nothing replaces the instincts, discretion, and insight that come from human connection. Relationship is not a soft skill — it’s a strategic asset in risk control.</p>

    <p>Let’s stop treating relationship as a sales tool only. It’s a bridge between compliance and performance — a firewall that alerts you when policies are about to be breached. Let’s strengthen our relationships, and we’ll find that control and credit efficiency naturally follow.</p>
